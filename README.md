# Hermes/CommonOrcish-3.3.5
An  addon that allows players from opposing factions to communicate through a workaround that converts common phrases or messages into neutral or decipherable language that bypasses Blizzard’s default faction chat filter.

# Using:
-As a Human speaking to Horde:
  /hermes Thank you

→ Displays to Horde as:
  T H AN K r Y O U

-As an Orc speaking to Alliance:
  /hermes Thank you

→ Displays to Alliance as:
  TH A N K n I O Il

-You can also yell cross-faction using:
  /yhermes Thank you

#Limitations:
It's impossible to make certain letters appear, so this addon tries to substitute them to something close.

Orcish suffers in particular, because it misses a bunch of potentially interchangeable letters: B, P, V, W, F.

No punctuation or numbers are possible. Only some latin letters.

Only single space can be posted. But it is possible to use some downcase letters as delimeters. Or you can post one word at a time.
