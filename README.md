# Hermes/CommonOrcish-3.3.5

An  addon that allows players from opposing factions to communicate through a workaround that converts common phrases or messages into neutral or decipherable language that bypasses Blizzard’s default faction chat filter.

# Using:
you can either use /hermes to say or /yhermes to yell

## As a Human speaking to Horde:

  /hermes Hello there stranger

→ Displays to Horde as:

## As an Orc speaking to Alliance:


  /hermes Hello there stranger

# Limitations:

It's impossible to make certain letters appear, so this addon tries to substitute them to something close.

Orcish suffers in particular, because it misses a bunch of potentially interchangeable letters: B, P, V, W, F.

No punctuation or numbers are possible. Only some latin letters.

Can't have a very long message, have to be a couple of words.
